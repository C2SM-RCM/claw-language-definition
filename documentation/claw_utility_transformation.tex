The \textbf{remove} directive allows the user to discard section of code
during the transformation process. 

\textbf{Options and details}\\
If the directive is directly followed by a structured block (\lstinline!IF! or \lstinline!DO!), the
end directive is not mandatory (see example \ref{remove1}). In any other cases, the end
directive is mandatory.
