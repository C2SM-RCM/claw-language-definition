\subsection{K caching (column caching)}
\begin{lstlisting}
!$claw kcache data(var_1[,var_2] ...) [offset(offset_1[ offset_2] ...)]] [init] [private]
\end{lstlisting}

In memory-bound problem, it might be useful to cache array values used several times during the current do statement iteration or for the next one.

The \textbf{kcache} directive is applied in a limited do statement block. It will cache the corresponding assigned value and update
the array index in the block according to the given plus/minus offsets. If the array referenced in the data clause is assigned in the block, 
the caching will take its place (see example \ref{kcache1}). Otherwise, an assignment statement is created to start the caching (see example \ref{kcache2}). 

If the offset values are omitted, there are inferred from the dimension of the variable to be cached and set to 0.

\textbf{Options and details}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{data}: The data clause specifies which array will be impacted by the column caching transformation. List of array identifiers. 
\item \textit{offset}: Integer value separated by a space that represents the offset at each dimension. 
\item \textit{init}: If the \textit{init} clause is specified, the cache variable will be initialized with the corresponding array value at the given offset during the 1st loop iteration. 
\item \textit{private}: it declares that a copy of each item on the list will be created
for each parallel gang on the accelerator. The list is the one specified on
the \textit{data} clause.
\end{itemize}




\subsection{On-the-fly computation (array access to function call)}
\begin{lstlisting}
!$claw call array_name=function_call(arg_list)
\end{lstlisting}

Sometimes, replacing access to pre-computed arrays with computation on-the-fly
can increase the performance. It can reduce the memory access for memory-bound
kernel and exploit some unused resources to execute the computation.

This transformation is local to the current do statement. Array access from the directive will be replaced. 

\textbf{Options and details}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{array\_name}: Array identifier. References to this array will be replaced by the function call in the current structured block. 
\item \textit{function\_call}: Name of the function provided by the user to compute the value. Return value must be of the same type as accessed value. 
\item \textit{arg\_list}: Comma separated list of arguments to be passed to the function call. 
\end{itemize}
