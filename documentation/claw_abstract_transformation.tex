\section{CLAW abstraction}


\subsection{Column model abstraction}

The \lstinline!parallelize! directive is used to parallelize a column based
algorithm. In weather prediction model, the physical parametrization is column
independent. This means that the algorithm to compute the different outputs, can
be defined with a single do statement iterating over the level of the column.
To parallelize efficiently this column computation over the domain, use this
directive.
The \lstinline!parallelize! directive is local to a subroutine. The algorithm
for the column computation must be enclosed in a subroutine.


\begin{lstlisting}
!$claw define dimension dim_id(lower_bound:upper_bound) &
[!$claw define dimension dim_id(lower_bound:upper_bound) &] ...
!$claw parallelize [data(data(var_1[,var_2] ...)] [over (dim_id|:[,dim_id|:] ...)]
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Options and details}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{define dimension}: Define a new dimension on which the column
model will be parallelized. The lower bound and upper bound of the defined
dimension can be either an integer constant or an integer variable. If a
variable if given, it will be added in order to the signature of the subroutine
as an \lstinline!INTENT(IN)! parameter.
\end{itemize}

If the \lstinline!data! clause is omitted, the promotion of variables is done as
follows:
Array variables declared with the \lstinline!INOUT! or \lstinline!OUT! intent
will be automatically promoted with the defined dimensions. The dimensions are
added on the left-side with the definition order.
In function of the target, intermediate scalar variable may also be promoted.
Scalar variable placed on the lhs of an assignment statement will be promoted
if the rhs references any variables (not a constant).

\subsection{K caching (column caching)}
\begin{lstlisting}
!$claw kcache data(var_1[,var_2] ...) [offset(offset_1[,offset_2] ...)]] [init] [private]
\end{lstlisting}

In memory-bound problem, it might be useful to cache array values used several
times during the current do statement iteration or for the next one.

The \textbf{kcache} directive is applied in a limited do statement block. It
will cache the corresponding assigned value and update the array index in the
block according to the given plus/minus offsets. If the array referenced in the
data clause is assigned in the block, the caching will take its place (see
example \ref{kcache1}). Otherwise, an assignment statement is created to start
the caching (see example \ref{kcache2}).

If the offset values are omitted, there are inferred from the dimension of the
variable to be cached and set to 0.

\textbf{Options and details}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{data}: The data clause specifies which array will be impacted by
the column caching transformation. List of array identifiers.
\item \textit{offset}: Integer value separated by a comma that represents the
offset at each dimension.
\item \textit{init}: If the \textit{init} clause is specified, the cache
variable will be initialized with the corresponding array value at the given
offset during the 1st loop iteration.
\item \textit{private}: it declares that a copy of each item on the list will
be created for each parallel gang on the accelerator. The list is the one
specified on the \textit{data} clause.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Code example}\\
\label{kcache1}
Where caching takes assignment place and \lstinline!init! clause.

Original code

DO j1 = k1start, k1end
  array_u6(j1,k3end) = pc1(j1,kend) * p2(j1)
ENDDO

DO j3 = k3start + 1, k3end
  DO j1 = k1start, k1end
    ! More computation here with others variables

    value1 = 1.0_dp / (1.0_dp - p2(j1) * (pc2(j1,j3) * array6(j1,j3-1)  &
                                     +  pc2(j1,j3) * array8(j1,j3-1) ))
    value2 = p2(j1) * (pc2(j1,j3) * array6(j1,j3-1)                     &
                      + pc2(j1,j3) * array8(j1,j3-1))
    value6 = p1(j1) * (pc2(j1,j3) * array6(j1,j3-1)                     &
                       +pc2(j1,j3) * array8(j1,j3-1))
	!$claw kcache data(array6) offset(0 -1) init
    array6(j1,j3) = p2(j1) * pc1(j1,j3)                                 &
                    + value2 * array8(j1,j3) + value6 * array8(j1,j3)
    array8(j1,j3) = p2(j1) * pc1(j1,j3)                                 &
                    + value6 * array2(j1,j3) + value7 * array4(j1,j3)
  END DO
END DO
\end{lstlisting}

END DO

transformation (see example \ref{kcache2}). Example with \lstinline!init! and
\lstinline!private! clause (see example \ref{kcache3}).

\subsection{On-the-fly computation (array access to function call)}
\begin{lstlisting}
!$claw call array_name=function_call(arg_list)
\end{lstlisting}

Sometimes, replacing access to pre-computed arrays with computation on-the-fly
can increase the performance. It can reduce the memory access for memory-bound
kernel and exploit some unused resources to execute the computation.

This transformation is local to the current do statement. Array access from the
directive will be replaced.

\textbf{Options and details}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{array\_name}: Array identifier. References to this array will be
replaced by the function call in the current structured block.
\item \textit{function\_call}: Name of the function provided by the user to
compute the value. Return value must be of the same type as accessed value.
\item \textit{arg\_list}: Comma separated list of arguments to be passed to
the function call.
\end{itemize}
