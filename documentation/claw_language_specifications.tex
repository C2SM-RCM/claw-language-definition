\section*{Conventions used in this document}

Keywords and punctuation that are part of the actual specification will appear
in typewriter font: \\

\lstinline|!$claw|\\

Italic font is used where a keyword or other name must be used: \\

\lstinline|!$claw| \textit{directive-name}\\

Optional syntax is enclosed in square brackets; an option that may be repeated
more than once is followed by ellipses:\\

\lstinline|!$claw| \textit{directive-name} [\textit{clause}
[[,] \textit{clause}]. . . ]

\section{General information about the CLAW language}
The directives are either local or global.

\begin{itemize}
\item Local directive: those directives have a limited impact on a local block
of code (for example, only in a subroutine or only in a do statement block)
\item Global directive: those directives can have an impact on the whole
translation unit.
\end{itemize}

The CLAW transformations are separated in two sections:
\begin{itemize}
\item CLAW high-level abstraction transformations: perform transformations
on abstraction based on domain science.
\item CLAW low-level directive transformations: perform basic transformations
based on the code structure.
\subitem Loop transformation
\subitem Specific transformation
\subitem Accelerator abstraction/helper transformation
\subitem Utility transformation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Line continuation}
CLAW directives can be defined on several lines using the continuation line
symbol. The syntax is described as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
!$claw directive clause &
!$claw clause
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Interpretation order of the CLAW directives}
The CLAW transformations can be combined together. For example,
\lstinline!loop-fusion! and \lstinline!loop-interchange! can be used together
in a group of nested loops.

The default application order of the transformations is defined as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \lstinline!ignore!
\item \lstinline!remove!
\item \lstinline!primitive!
\item \lstinline!array-transform!
\item \lstinline!loop-extract!
\item \lstinline!loop-hoist!
\item \lstinline!loop-fusion!
\item \lstinline!loop-interchange!
\item \lstinline!on-the-fly!
\item \lstinline!kcache!
\item \lstinline!if extract!
\item \lstinline!parallelize!
\item \lstinline!parallelize forward!
\item formatting transformation (internal use transformation)
\end{enumerate}

Users must be aware that transformations are applied sequentially and
therefore, a transformation can be performed on code that has already been
transformed.

\subsection{Accelerator compile guard}
As CLAW generates accelerator directives, it might be useful sometimes to
protect the compilation of source code including accelerator directives as it
might be wrong if the CLAW FORTRAN Compiler didn't process it.

For this reason, the CLAW language has a compile guard that is removed by the
CLAW FORTRAN Compiler while it applies the other transformations. This compile
guard is designed to make the compilation failed when transformations are not
applied and accelerator directives are present in the source code.

The compile guard is shown in the listing below. It uses the target accelerator
language with a specific claw directive. Example for OpenACC on line 2 and
OpenMP on line 3.

\begin{lstlisting}
!$<accelerator language prefix> claw-guard
!$acc claw-guard
!$omp claw-guard
\end{lstlisting}

This line is then removed once the transformations are applied.

\section{CLAW low-level directive transformations}

\subsection{Global clauses}
The following clauses can be applied to any kind of low-level transformations.

\subsubsection{Target clause}
The target clause specify for which transformed target the transformation is
active. If no target is specified, the transformation is active for any target.

\lstset{emph={directive,specific_target}, emphstyle=\itshape}
\begin{lstlisting}
!$claw directive [target(specific_target)]
\end{lstlisting}

The \lstinline|specific_target| is one of the value provided by the compiler.
